## Exporting Markdown to PDF

There are [many ways to do this](https://gist.github.com/justincbagley/ec0a6334cc86e854715e459349ab1446), but I personally use the [Markdown PDF extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf) in VS Code to export my documents. After you install the extension, simply go to the `.md` file you want to export, open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), and search for 'Markdown PDF: Export (pdf)'.

Documents that use LaTeX expressions have a special `<script>` element appended at the end to help this extension correctly render the math expressions, something I had trouble getting to work with the other methods.
